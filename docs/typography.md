Uses the [Atkinson Hyperlegibile](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) typeface. Has four font files (regular, italic, bold, bold+italic).

Currently loaded via `site.css` and self-hosted int the `/static/fonts` folder (which is copied into the `/fonts` directory during a build step).

A custom `tailwind.config.js` config sets this as the default font face for the site.
