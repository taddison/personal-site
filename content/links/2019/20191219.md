- Why invest in creating a new systems programming language? According to Microsoft, the answers are security, and legacy:
  - [Digital security by design - security and legacy at Microsoft]
- Based on the most recent [SQL ConstantCare stats], what versions of SQL are in the wild? As of December 2019, not a whole lot of 2019, and even 2017 is in a minority (15%). Big boxes (>33 cores) are also notably absent (5%). As someone used to working with 2017 (soon 2019) on some _really_ big boxes, I wonder where my big-box brethren are.
- Liz Fong-Jones with an impassioned plea to [write less code], and instead see if you can first start by composing, or _engineering_ a solution.
- Taking composition to an extreme, this thought-provoking writeup of Déjà Vu covers academic work that attempts to make building web apps an exercise in selecting the right legos:
  - [Declarative assembly of web applications from pre-defined concepts]
- [Charticulator] is an [open source][charticulator on github] visualization generator - the learning curve is a little steep, but the gallery ably demonstrates the breadth of visualizations possible.
- [Monzo's progression framework] is an excellent engineering ladder to draw inspiration from (plus a bunch of other roles). Backed by a GatsbyJS app over markdown files if you want to [make it your own].
- [This board] contains a bunch of items that either increased momentum, or failed but taught the team something new. Love the framing, and think there are a lot of really interesting ideas (on both sides!). The ideas were sourced from a workshop involving product managers from various organizations.
- State of the art privacy protection in web browsers is getting pretty sophisticated. This article on [Fingerprinting and privacy budgets] from Brave has me in two minds - I care deeply about privacy, but as an operator occasionally tasked with separating bots from real users, I can imagine some of these techniques making that task a little (lot) harder.
