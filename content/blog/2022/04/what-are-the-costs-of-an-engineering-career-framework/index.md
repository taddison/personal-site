- What are the benefits (see: infinity of posts)
- What needs do career frameworks serve?
- Are there any other ways we could solve those needs without paying the costs?
- What _are_ the costs?

## Easy to see costs

- Time to build framework
- Time to maintain framework (changing business needs, technology landscape)
- Time to train people to use the framework for hiring, promotion
- Time spent coaching people to progress through the framework

## Hard to see costs

- People making decisions based on framework progression vs. solving customer problems
  - We _cannot_ expect people to not be self-interested. If there’s a 200k+ raise on the line it would be irrational for people to not pursue that.
- Managers making decisions based on framework progression for their subordinates (e.g., project selection)
- Managing through disagreements on individual’s level/lack of promotion
- Process Handcuffs - if we stick to the framework it may prevent us from hiring people who add substantial customer value (fail to meet some specific definition for Staff Engineer, etc.).
  - And if you allow exceptions to exist that don't force an update to the framework...
  - Maybe generalize to people who fall between the cracks of frameworks (from Yvonne's tweet - TODO research for attribution)
