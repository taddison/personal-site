I've rarely seen the costs / return on investment (ROI) mentioned when discussing career progression frameworks. It turns out there are lots of interesting costs to be aware of, and some of them can be significant. If you're planning to roll out a framework, being aware of the costs as well as the benefits will increase the chance of your framework coming down on the right side of the ROI calculation.

I was inspired to dig into this by Yvonne Lam's thread [what needs do levels serve][yvonne tweet], which contains the insightful question _"what problems are orgs choosing to have when they introduce levels"_. The related question of _"how else can could those needs be served"_ is also fascinating, but we'll stick to costs for now.

## Visible Costs

Starting with the costs that are easiest to see, these are costs that will be incurred and are directly linked to building and leveraging a framework.

The first cost is **building the framework**. Even with a wealth of [inspiration to draw from][progression.fyi] the first draft of the framework will take several hours. Iterating towards a version you're ready to roll out will take dozens of hours from multiple people, with the cost increasing proportional to the ambition and complexity of your framework (how many roles? how many levels?).

Just like any other product you build, the initial cost pales next to the cost to **maintain the framework**. Technology definitely won't stand still, and hopefully neither will your company. There will be bugs and inconsistencies in the framework that will only be uncovered as you start to use it. A rule of thumb is probably whatever it took to build you'll be spending in annual maintenance costs if you want to keep it relevant.

A well built and maintained framework will need to be used to actually deliver any value - which means you're going to have to spend time **training people to use and apply the framework**. If you're going to use your framework for career growth as well as recruiting, this is potentially going to mean you'll also need to **align your recruiting evaluation with your framework**. This is going to be both a large upfront investment as well as ongoing work for every employee and interview loop.

I don't see any of these costs as avoidable if you want to build an effective framework. The only suggestion I'd offer is ensure you focus on 'good enough' at each step and assemble the smallest possible group of people to own the framework. The heuristic I've most often used is if adding another person doesn't meaningfully increase the diversity of the group, don't make the group any larger.

Now we're done with the visible and fairly innocuous costs, let's dig into the tricky ones.

## Invisible Costs

- People making decisions based on framework progression vs. solving customer problems
  - We _cannot_ expect people to not be self-interested. If there’s a 200k+ raise on the line it would be irrational for people to not pursue that.
- Managers making decisions based on framework progression for their subordinates (e.g., project selection)
- Managing through disagreements on individual’s level/lack of promotion
- Process Handcuffs - if we stick to the framework it may prevent us from hiring people who add substantial customer value (fail to meet some specific definition for Staff Engineer, etc.).
  - And if you allow exceptions to exist that don't force an update to the framework...
  - Maybe generalize to people who fall between the cracks of frameworks (from Yvonne's tweet - TODO research for attribution)
