I've been a Windows power user (personally and professionally) for over 20 years. In December 2020 I switched my primary machine to an M1 MacBook Pro and macOS, from a Surface Book 3 and Windows 10. After two months with the setup I'm sharing my early thoughts on the transition, including advice on what made it effective.

My workload consists primarily of using the office suite (someone once jokingly told me moving deeper into management meant switching an IDE out for Word/Outlook - it wasn't a joke, and they left off Excel!), with some recreational coding (Node/React) and SQL Server development. I spend a lot of time consuming written content on the web.
