When considering someone for a management role I've seen people mistake kindness for empathy. Having a kind manager is definitely better than having an unkind manager, but to effectively manage people you should be looking for an empathetic manager.

> I've seen this happen on multiple occasions - in some cases an individual confuses their own kind behaviour for empathy! The rather low baseline for engineering managers probably plays a part here, where a table-stakes trait like kindness sets you apart as a potential manager. In addition to that, we continue to put people into management positions who are incapable and/or unqualified for the role because we have [no idea what to look for](**WILL LARSON GETTING TO YES LINK**).

This doesn't mean that kindness isn't something I look for - it's actually one of the first things I want to see When evaluating people management capabilities:

1. Are they kind?
1. Are they empathetic?
1. Are they curious about their team?

But before we get too far, we need to look a little closer at that 'kind' word.

## You can't always be kind

Although advice like 'be unfailingly kind' and 'keep your feedback actionable, specific, and kind' sounds great, [Chelsea Troy](**CHELSEA TROY BLOG**) points out the problem with that statement, namely:

> ...it assumes that the feedback giver has control over whether their feedback is perceived as kind. And they donâ€™t.
> _from [Transcript from lecture: Giving and receiving feedback](https://chelseatroy.com/2019/05/15/giving-and-receiving-feedback/)_

This goes beyond feedback, and extends to all interactions with multiple parties - kindness is really in the eye of the beholder, and so the best you can do is _act with kind intent_.

Anyone who can share examples of where they've experienced a gap between their intent (be kind) and the impact (not perceived as kind) does well here. The best candidates will be able to share examples of where they've changed the way they interact to minimise that gap (a great example Chelsea share's is not giving feedback if someone is not looking for feedback).

Being able to act with kind intent requires empathy, which we'll come onto next.

## Empathy isn't only for kind people

The reason I'm looking for kindness before empathy is because being empathetic isn't locked away down the nice-person skill tree. I'd argue that some of the most hurtful people are incredibly empathetic and leverage that to cause significant harm. Testing for empathy without controlling for kindness can let brilliant jerks through, so I'd never start here.

Empathy is often seen presented alongside sympathy and compassion, something like:

- Sympathy - I am sorry you're going through that
- Empathy - I can imagine what it must feel like to be going through that
- Compassion - What can I do to help

This framing sticks with people, such that being empathetic benefits from the positive associations of sympathy and compassion, despite empathy being somewhat orthogonal to those traits.

Assuming you've verified kind intent, checking for empathy typically starts with the question 'what were they thinking?'. This can either be used in made-up scenarios (you request a meeting to discuss progress on a project which isn't going well), but are best when you're discussing real scenarios (delivering a performance review, promotion, termination, mediating a heated debate).

The best candidates will be able to answer a wide variety of follow ups:

- What were they trying to achieve?
- What were they thinking but didn't feel they could say, and why?
- What was their biggest concern?

But empathy alone isn't why they'll excel here, because empathy works best when paired with a deep knowledge of the individual.

## Curious about their team

Every new manager starts out with almost zero knowledge of their new team. No amount of empathy or kind intent can make up for this, and so curiosity and a commitment to learn more about their team is crucial.

I've found this is best evaluated alongside empathy with the follow-up question 'and why did you think that?'. I'm not sure if there is a clear distinction on good vs. great here as having _any_ answer here is probably a good sign (most candidates stumble at empathy).

Interestingly, I've seen a mix of both talent and skill at work here. Some people are more naturally talented (curious) and will always look to learn more. Other people aren't, but are able to make up for that deficit with a system/approach they apply. In either case, one common factor is consistency. If you don't show up and spend time with your team every week, it doesn't matter how good your system is/how talented you are - you'll never learn anything.

### An aside on bias

One thing that can sometimes crop up here is bias, which can be a tricky conversation to navigate if the candidate isn't aware of their own biases.

Imagine we're discussing a heated debate on some technical decision, and one engineer starts to raise their voice. The candidate suggests the female engineer is probably upset, because they are shouting. And when you ask why, maybe prompting if they'd have said their male colleague was passionate because they were shouting, you've got a coaching opportunity.

This is far more common in 1:1s with team members than it is in interviews, but it has happened and if you are going to pursue lines of questions about 'what were they thinking & why' I'd encourage you to be ready to have the follow-up.

If you'd like to read more on bias I'd strongly encourage you to work through all the links at the start of [Why your efforts to make your company inclusive aren't working](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/05/24/why-your-efforts-to-make-your-company-inclusive-arent-working/).

## In summary

It's good to be kind, but that's just the start. To be a great people manager (or to look for if filling a people manager role) is people who:

1. Act with kind intent
1. Are empathetic
1. Are curious about their team

I'm not convinced that any of these are areas that cannot be improved consciously, and so when evaluating people consider how receptive they are to getting better, in addition to where they are today.

And don't make the mistake of assuming because someone is kind that they'll be empathetic.
