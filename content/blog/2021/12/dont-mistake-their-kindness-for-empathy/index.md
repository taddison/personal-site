## Comments from review

- Opening sentence - tie to title (Al Capone kindness != weakness)
- Confusing section on sympathy/empathy/compassion - not clear what 'empathy does not belong' means
- Goal is to make clear two different points - if you'll be perceived as kind is not in your control, and kindness is not a substitute (or even prerequisite!) for empathy
- Intent is to target at anyone thinking about people management - primarily written as some advice for anyone considering hiring or promoting someone into a manager (or manager of manager) role, but there is interesting growth work for many (all?) people
- Article is targeting tech/software engineering - the tone of 'we don't really know how to manage well' is particularly relevant

## Article

## Draft

I'd put the advice 'be kind' in the same bucket as 'buy low sell high'. Great soundbite/tweet bereft of any useful implementation details.

Two main challenges.

First of all, you're not in control of whether your feedback is kind or not. From Chelsea Troy, on the problem with trying to ensure your feedback is 'kind':

> ...it assumes that the feedback giver has control over whether their feedback is perceived as kind. And they donâ€™t.

From [Transcript from lecture: Giving and receiving feedback](https://chelseatroy.com/2019/05/15/giving-and-receiving-feedback/).

I'm pretty certain this generalizes beyond feedback to all interactions. Acting with kindness is not the same as being received with kindness.

This leads us on to the second challenge, which is kindness is not empathy.

I've seen this when discussing potential candidates for manager/manager of manager positions. Empathy is essential for these roles, and if you don't know what you're looking for (insert comment around nobody knows how to interview/evaluate) you might mistake someone's kindness for empathy.

Let's recap a few words:

- Sympathy - I am sorry you're going through that
- Empathy - I can imagine what it must feel like to be going through that
- Compassion - What can I do to help

I'd argue empathy doesn't really belong there, as you can definitely be a mean, empathetic individual (I'd argue some of the worst people I've met were in the smart, empathetic, asshole camp). I'm not sure you can display mean sympathy or mean compassion.

Perhaps the fact that displaying kindness is enough to get someone considered for a management position is a sad incdictment of the quality of most managers. That or the fact [brilliance bias](https://rishikeshs.com/brilliance-bias/) casts everything for our (mostly male) managers in the best possible light.

The good news is this is a fairly simple problem to overcome once you know about it. Try asking 'what were they thinking' and see what you get.

> Keep in mind this might not be something they've asked themselves often, if ever. You should be prepared to find a lot of projection, and any biases they hold will present. Even people who are naturally empathetic but unaware of their own biases will need coaching here.

Assuming you've got someone who is acting with the intent to be perceived as kind (which we'll call kind, as I cannot find a more succinct phrasing right now) with empathy, are you done? Almost. If you examine reasons why feedback delivered may be perceived as unkind you'll quickly notice they are typically a result of a misalignment in what the person wants vs. what you provided them.

Empathy operates on the knowledge you have about the other person, and so a curiosity and commitment to build a deeper understanding of the person you're speaking to is important. A great follow-up to 'what were they thinking' is 'why did you think that'.

This leaves us with the following rubric for evaluating a potential manager for...whatever it is we're evaluating:

- Kind (more specifically acts with kind intent)
- Empathetic
- Commitment to build a deeper understanding of others

Maybe there's a better way of phrasing that last point, and I think it's actually a couple of different things (the skill of building the deeper understanding - which is yours and can be improved, and the actual understanding you have of others, which starts at zero with each new person you meet and gradually decays over time if you don't actively 'top it up' as people grow).
