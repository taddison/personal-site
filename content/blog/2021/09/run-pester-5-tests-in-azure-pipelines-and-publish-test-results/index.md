The brevity of the [Migrating from Pester v4 to v5] documentation belies just how much has changed - something that took a fair bit of trial and error for me was getting [Pester] 5 test results published in an [Azure Pipelines] run.

Assuming you have your tests located in a `CI` folder, the script to invoke the tests should look like this:

```powershell
# /ci/RunTests.ps1
Import-Module Pester

Invoke-Pester -CI
```

Specifying `-CI` will save test results in an xml file (NUnitXML compatible) in the same folder. It will also set the exit code of the process to the number of failed tests, which is problematic as any non-zero exit code will abort the pipeline by default. To ensure our pipeline continues when test fail we set `ignoreLASTEXITCODE` on the [PowerShell task].

> To abort the pipeline in the presence of failed tasks we use the `failTaskOnFailedTests` property of the [Publish Test Results task].

```yaml
# /pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml
pool:
  vmImage: windows-2019

steps:
  - task: PowerShell@2
    displayName: "Run Pester tests"
    inputs:
      filePath: "./ci/RunTests.ps1"
      ignoreLASTEXITCODE: true

  - task: PublishTestResults@2
    inputs:
      testResultsFormat: "NUnit"
      testResultsFiles: "**/Test-*.xml"
      failTaskOnFailedTests: true
      testRunTitle: "Validate Task Files"
```

In the example code, I'm running the [Test-FolderTask] function of [tSqlScheduler], and as you can see when I break the build on purpose, the tests fail ðŸ˜Š.
