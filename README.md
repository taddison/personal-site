## Ideas

- Book list (.md per book, some metadata, use to create lists I can link to when people ask 'what would you suggest I read for...')
- Link list (all the interesting links - put them somewhere so I can find them again, temporal)
- Articles (longer-lived reference sources that are evergreen)
- Non-technical blog articles (collapse into /blog or maybe /me or something else?)
