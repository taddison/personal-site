- Navigation
  - Large post titles render funny prev/next buttons - reconsider (next/prev or truncated titles?)
- About
  - Contact form could be implemented
- Refactor
  - Post list component - same in post list and index
    --> Maybe the index page shouldn't be unique? But if the blog will ever have a different landing page this is where it'll be implemented
  - Next/Previous components - Used in a few places, as both a visual glyph (next/prev button for posts + pages), and pagination logic also feels redundant
