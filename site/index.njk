Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I <a href="/blog">write a blog</a> on mostly engineering topics (ranging from SQL Server to Gatsby), and occasionally publish <a href="/blog/tags#Links">link roundups</a> of stuff I find interesting. You can also read a little more <a href="/about">about me</a>, or see what I'm up to on <a href="https://www.github.com/taddison" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
